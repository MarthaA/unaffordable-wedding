      <h2>Inspired by Pinterest</h2>
      <p class="first-pullquote">Things add up quickly. The average cost of weddings in the United States has soared to $26,444. Couples are overwhelmed with this number and feel that weddings have to be expensive. Which yes, on average they are. Here's what the average looks like.</p>

      <p>The statics from <a href="http://www.costofwedding.com/">Cost of Wedding</a> were created to help couples understand real wedding costs. Though the real weddings they are talking about are mainstream weddings that often will put couples in debt. Cost of Wedding has some good advice that a couple should expect to pay, on average, 50% to 100%+ more when choosing well-experienced professionals, designer labels, popular event locations, unique or custom products and services. Low-budget weddings are not for every couple just as high-end weddings are not right for everyone.

      <h2>If You're Getting Married Right After College</h2>
      <p class="first-pullquote">Weddings don't have to be unaffordable. It's all about figuring out the few things that are important to the couple and knowing where to cut corners, whether it's a weekday wedding or it takes place during an off-season. Here's what that looks like.</p>

      <p>Simply put, if you want to save money you can't have everything you want. What's appealing about low-budget weddings is that they focus more on the wedding ceremony and its meaning rather than the fluff that surrounds it. Being creative can allow for compromises. Choosing a weekday wedding can cut costs in half for different venues and then it's possible to have the location without the high price tag. Off-season weddings are another way to save money on parts of a wedding. Below is an example of how my own personal wedding budget is shaping up.
